# BlueZone: Augason Skate Analysis – Project Wiki

## Project Description

BlueZone is a mobile app that helps skaters explore and evaluate skateparks around the California Bay Area. It offers information that matters both to experienced skaters and to families with young children. Users can browse a list of skateparks, view photos, check terrain types, and read short reviews.

As a father of two young daughters who are both learning to skate, I created BlueZone to support both adult skaters and parents looking for safe, welcoming parks. Whether one is looking for bowls or just wants a clean place to skate with kids, my app aims to help.

My project blends personal experience with practical mobile development. I skate regularly with my two daughters, and we visit parks across the Bay. BlueZone will reflect that mix of adventure and safety, offering a balanced view of each park’s features.

## Problem Being Addressed

Most skatepark apps are outdated, hard to use, or lack meaningful filters. They often miss the kind of detail a parent or skater needs. BlueZone addresses the gap. It will focus on specific things skaters and parents care about.  

Is the park clean? Is it safe? Is it more street or transition? Is it good for kids? Are the bowls in good shape? These are questions that come up in real conversations, not just online reviews. BlueZone helps answer those questions quickly, all in one place.
